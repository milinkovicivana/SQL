One of the faculty projects. The task was to choose one website, assume what's in the back and make a database so that it matches the content that we see on the website.
My choice was https://www.gym.rs/. 

Script 1 - database model;
Script 2 - data insert;
Script 3 - querying data;
Script 4 - views, stored procedures, functions, triggers, transactions
